# HD-DOT
This repository contains a description of the procedures and associated files to implement and analyze HD-DOT images in dogs and humans.

As I'm deploying this technique for the first time in dogs (at least in our lab), the first goal of the project consists on comparing an HD-DOT image and a fMRI of my dogs Odin and Kun-kun. The images will be from the same auditory paradigm and will be compared in terms of signal quality, localization consistency and maybe others.

The adquisition of an HD-DOT image requires developing a procedures that can be separated in three phases. Pre-acquisition, data acquisition and data processing.
